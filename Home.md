  - [`paths.scad`](paths.scad): Functions and modules to work with arbitrary 3D paths.
  - [`beziers.scad`](beziers.scad): Functions and modules to work with bezier curves.

### Standard Parts

  - [`wiring.scad`](wiring.scad): Modules to render routed bundles of wires.

### Miscellaneous
  - [`constants.scad`](constants.scad): Useful constants for vectors, edges, etc.
  - [`math.scad`](math.scad): Useful helper functions.
  - [`convex_hull.scad`](convex_hull.scad): Functions to create 2D and 3D convex hulls.
  - [`quaternions.scad`](quaternions.scad): Functions to work with quaternion rotations.
  - [`triangulation.scad`](triangulation.scad): Functions to triangulate `polyhedron()` faces that have more than 3 vertices.
  - [`debug.scad`](debug.scad): Modules to help debug creation of beziers, `polygons()`s and `polyhedron()`s

## Terminology
For purposes of these library files, the following terms apply:
- **Left**: Towards X-
- **Right**: Towards X+
- **Front**/**Forward**: Towards Y-
- **Back**/**Behind**: Towards Y+
- **Bottom**/**Down**/**Below**: Towards Z-
- **Top**/**Up**/**Above**: Towards Z+

- **Axis-Negative**: Towards the negative end of the axis the object is oriented on.  IE: X-, Y-, or Z-.
- **Axis-Positive**: Towards the positive end of the axis the object is oriented on.  IE: X+, Y+, or Z+.

## Common Arguments:

Args    | What it is
------- | ----------------------------------------
fillet  | Radius of rounding for interior or exterior edges.
chamfer | Size of chamfers/bevels for interior or exterior edges.
orient  | Axis a part should be oriented along.  Given as an XYZ triplet of rotation angles.  It is recommended that you use the `ORIENT_` constants from `constants.scad`.  Default is usually `ORIENT_Z` for vertical orientation.
align   | Side of the origin that the part should be on.  Given as a vector away from the origin.  It is recommended that you use the `V_` constants from `constants.scad`.  Default is usually `V_ZERO` for centered.
